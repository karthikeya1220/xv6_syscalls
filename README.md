## Question 1:  System Calls Implemented: `cps`, `signal`, `pthread`, `message queue`

### Problem Overview
In this project we aimed to implement 4 new system calls and addd them to the xv6-riscv operating system.
#### 1. **cps**
   Displays all the processes currently running, their process IDs and current states.

#### 2. **pthread**
  Implemented a create thread function and alloted a kernel stack for each thread during execution.

#### 3. **signal**
   Implemented default handler for a user generated inteerupt (`SIG_INT`).<br/>
   Added Ctrl+C as a command to send a user-interrupt

.

### Methodology:
#### 1. **System Call Numbers**:
   Each system call has a unique number by which it it identified in the system call registry.<br/>
   Every time a system call is used, the system triggers an interrupt with a particular number which denotes the system call.
#### 2. **Definitions**:
   Implementation of the logic of the system call is divided among files to handle all the cases efficiently.
#### 3. **User-Space Wrapping**:
   The definitions and logic of the implementation of the system calls should not be accessible to the user.<br/>
   So, a wrapper function was inplemented in the user-space to send the arguments required by a system call which can be accessed from the user-space<br/>
   This wrapper function is responsible to pass all the required arguments to the system call.<br/>
   Important to add this wrapper function to the function registry to make sure that the function is mapped from the user-space to the kernel-space.

```

#### For cps:
```
$ cps
```
#### For Signal:
```
$ signal
```
#### For Thread:
```
$ thread_test
```
#### For Message Queue:
```
$ msgtest
```

## Question 2: Multi-Threaded File Management System  
**Topics Implemented:** `pthread`, `synchronization`, `signals`,`socket programming`

In this project, we aim to implement a file management system where multiple clients (threads) can perform concurrent file operations on a server. The operations include reading, writing, renaming, copying, deleting files, and accessing metadata, as well as logging activities. We used socket programming to simulate the client-server interaction, and synchronized access to resources using pthreads, semaphores, and signal handling to ensure thread safety.

### Features Implemented:
1. **Concurrent File Reading**  
   Multiple clients can read the same file at the same time without causing conflicts.

2. **One Client Only at a Time File Writing**  
   File write operations are mutually exclusive, meaning only one client can write to a particular file at any given time.

3. **File Deletion (One Client at a Time)**  
   File deletion is also mutually exclusive, ensuring no two clients can delete the same file simultaneously.

4. **File Renaming (One Client at a Time)**  
   Similar to deletion, file renaming is handled in a way that only one client can rename a file at a time.

5. **File Copying**  
   A client can copy a file to a new file, and this operation ensures no other operation is allowed to write during copying.

6. **File Metadata Reading**  
   Clients can read the metadata of files (e.g., size, creation date, etc.) also making sure no other operation writes as the details will change.

7. **Activity Logging (Readable Only by Server)**  
   All activities performed by the clients are logged, but only the server can access and read these logs. If client tries to access a negative acknowledgement is sent to the respective client.

8. **File Compression**  
   Clients can compress files to save space. This operation is handled by the server and executed in a controlled manner.

9. **File Decompression**  
   Clients can decompress files, which are then made available for further operations.

10. **File Wise Restriction**
   Each of the file has its own read and write lock (`semaphore`) therefore enabling the scenario where one client is writing on say file1.txt the rest of the files are still available to perform operations on for rest of the clients

11. **Access Control List (File restrictions for select users)**
   There is a acl.txt (access control list) where there is client id, file_name, read_access and write_access which is being reused for other functions with similar semaphore accesses. The clients will be asked to enter their client id and then the client id is matched with the acl.txt and upon requesting the file (only if the file exists in acl.txt and if permission is true (read/write)) the operation will be executed from the server side.

 ```
   client1 vk.txt 1 0
   client1 file3.txt 0 1
   client2 file3.txt 1 1
   client2 file4.txt 1 0
 ```
 The admin has the freedom to edit the acl.txt (the files not mentioned in acl.txt including itself and log.txt and any other files are by default read-0 and write-0)

### Methodology:
1. **Server and Client Setup**  
   - The server code is implemented in `server.c`, and clients are implemented using `client1.c` and `client2.c` (scalable to more clients).
   - The server listens for incoming connections from clients through a TCP socket.

2. **Thread Creation**  
   - Once the client-server connection is established, each client is assigned a unique `pthread` using `pthread_create`. The client IDs and pthreads are stored in arrays.

3. **Menu-driven Interface**  
   - The client program runs infinitely in a terminal, allowing users to interact with the server by selecting different options.
   - The server receives the client’s choice and spawns threads to execute the requested tasks concurrently.

4. **Semaphore for Synchronization**  
   - The server manages the read-write-execute (rwx) permissions using semaphores. Depending on the requested task, the server either executes the operation or waits for the necessary permissions to be released.

5. **Signal Handling**  
   - Error handling is done using signals to manage unexpected events or invalid operations during communication between the server and clients.

### Synchronization and Error Handling:
- **Semaphores** are used to synchronize access to critical resources such as file writing, deletion, renaming, and compression. This ensures that one client’s operation does not interfere with another’s, especially when modifying files.
  
- **Signals** are used to handle errors, such as invalid file paths, insufficient permissions, or unsuccessful file operations. The server communicates these errors to the client via signals.

### Dependencies to install 
1. ZLIB : Used to compress and decompress the files.

   ```
   sudo apt install zlib1g-dev 
   ``` 
2. GLIB : Used to maintain file wise mutex using inbuilt hashmaps and defined structures.
   ```
   sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
   ```

### How to Run:
1. Compile all files (`server.c`, `client1.c`, `client2.c`).
2. Start the server:  
   ```
   gcc server.c -o server $(pkg-config --cflags --libs glib-2.0) -pthread -lz
   ```
   ```
   ./server
   ```
3. Start multiple clients preferably in different terminals:  
   ```
   gcc client1.c -o client1
   ```  
   ```
   ./client1
   ```
   
   Repeat for `client2.c` or more clients.
   
4. The client will prompt for an option from the menu. The server will process the request based on the client’s input and handle synchronization.
